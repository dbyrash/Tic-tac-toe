# Tic-tac-toe

Implemented Tic-tac-toe game by utilizing the ReactComponentAPI. This is the 2-player and vs. computer game using ReactJS, CSS and HTML. 
I deep dived into understanding theReact concepts including elements, components, props, and state. 
This allows one to - 

- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
